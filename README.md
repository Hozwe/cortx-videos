# CORTX Videos

A collection of videos about CORTX.  Using this repo as a temporary way to quickly store videos.  Putting them in a separate repo so they don't bloat other repos and slow down a git checkout/clone.  Note that eventually all videos should be hosted in youtube so this is just a temporary location to make it easy for folks to upload videos without waiting on youtube.
